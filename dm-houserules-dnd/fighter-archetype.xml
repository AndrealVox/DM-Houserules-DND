         <p>At 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>

            <span class="feature">Superiority Dice.</span> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.<br />

            <li>When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll.</li>
            <li>When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability before or after rolling damage.</li>
            <li>When you make a Perception or Insight check, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this ability before or after seeing the total but before learning if you succeeded or failed.</li>
