        <description>All of the characters in the Avatar: The Last Airbender setting are human, but their country of origin has a major influence on their abilities, especially if they have the ability to bend one of the elements. The four "races," then, in the campaign setting here would be the societal differences between the four nations: Air Nomads, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Water Tribe. In other settings or with mixes, I recommend trying out different homebrew races or the classic 5e races. Have fun with it!</description>
