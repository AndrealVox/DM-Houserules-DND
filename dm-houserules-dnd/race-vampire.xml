         <h4>VAMPIRE TRAITS</h4>
         <p>Your vampire character has the following traits.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Like the Human you came from only stronger, your ability scores each increase by 2.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>Vampires don’t mature and age in the same way that other races do. Every living vampire is either a Blood Lord, infected by "The Father" in the distant reaches of the past, or was spawned by a bloodchief from a living human. Most vampires are thus very old in years.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Vampires have a strict hierarchy that incline them toward a lawful alignment. They may or may not become evil depending on how they chose to feed throughout their life.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Vampire are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your swiftness grants you a base walking speed of 40 feet.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Vampiric Resistance. </i></b>You have resistance to bludgeoning and necrotic damage.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Superior Darkvision.</i></b>Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Vampire and one extra language of your choice.</p>
         <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies. </i></b>You are proficiency in Intimidation, Perception, Persuasion and Stealth.</p>

         <p>As an action, you can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw, or be charmed. The DC for the save is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under your direct control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.</p>
         <p>Each time you or one of your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 1 hour, until you are destroyed, until you on a different plane of existence than the target, or if you take a bonus action to end the effect. You can only have one creature charmed this way at once and you can use this trait a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier before you must complete a long rest before using it again.</p>
